# Getting Started

## Install Dev Dependencies

Before you can start working on your Expo project, you'll need to install its development dependencies. You can do this using either npm or Yarn:

```sh
npm install
```
### OR
```sh
yarn install
```

## Running the App

Once you have the dependencies installed, you can run your app in development mode. This will enable you to see your app on both your device and the Expo app:

```sh
npm start
```
### OR
```sh
yarn start
```
